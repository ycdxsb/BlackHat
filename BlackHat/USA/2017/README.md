### Stepping Up Our Game: Re-focusing the Security Community on Defense and Making Security Work for Everyone

### 'Ghost Telephonist' Link Hijack Exploitations in 4G LTE CS Fallback
In this presentation, one vulnerability in CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback) in 4G LTE network is introduced. In the CSFB procedure, we found the authentication step is missing. The result is that an attacker can hijack the victim's communication. We named this attack as 'Ghost Telephonist.' Several exploitations can be made based on this vulnerability. When the call or SMS is not encrypted, or weakly encrypted, the attacker can get the content of the victim's call and SMS. The attacker can also initiate a call/SMS by impersonating the victim. Furthermore, Telephonist Attack can obtain the victim's phone number and then use the phone number to make advanced attack, e.g. breaking Internet online accounts. The victim will not sense being attacked since no 4G or 2G fake base station is used and no cell re-selection. These attacks can randomly choose victims or target a given victim. We verified these attacks with our own phones in operators' network in a small controllable scale. The experiments proved the vulnerability really exists. Finally, the countermeasures are proposed and now we are collaborating with operators and terminal manufactures to fix this vulnerability.

### (in)Security in Building Automation: How to Create Dark Buildings with Light Speed
A number of talks in the last few years have addressed various topics in the generic area of industrial control system insecurity but only few have tapped into security of building automation systems, albeit its prevalence.

### A New Era of SSRF - Exploiting URL Parser in Trending Programming Languages!
We propose a new exploit technique that brings a whole-new attack surface to bypass SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) protections. This is a very general attack approach, in which we used in combination with our own fuzzing tool to discover many 0days in built-in libraries of very widely-used programming languages, including Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Wget and cURL. The root cause of the problem lies in the inconsistency of URL parsers and URL requesters.

### Advanced Pre-Breach Planning: Utilizing a Purple Team to Measure Effectiveness vs. Maturity

### Adventures in Attacking Wind Farm Control Networks
Wind farms are becoming a leading source for renewable energy. The increased reliance on wind energy makes wind farm control systems attractive targets for attackers. This talk explains how wind farm control networks work and how they can be attacked in order to negatively influence wind farm operations (e.g., wind turbine hijacking). Specifically, implementations of the IEC 61400-25 family of communications protocols are investigated (i.e., OPC XML-DA). This research is based on an empirical study of a variety of U.S. based wind farms conducted over a two year period. We explain how these security assessments reveal that wind farm vendor design and implementation flaws have left wind turbine programmable automation controllers and OPC servers vulnerable to attack. Additionally, proof-of-concept attack tools are developed in order to exploit wind farm control network design and implementation vulnerabilities.

### All Your SMS & Contacts Belong to ADUPS & Others
Our research has identified several models of Android mobile devices that contained firmware that collected sensitive personal data about their users and transmitted this sensitive data to third-party servers in China - without disclosure or the users' consent. These devices were available through major US-based online retailers (Amazon, BestBuy, for example) and included popular smartphones such as the BLU R1 HD and the BLU Life One X2. These devices actively transmitted user and device information including the full-body of text messages, call history with full telephone numbers, unique device identifiers including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), serial number, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The firmware could target specific users and text messages matching remotely-defined keywords. The firmware also collected and transmitted information about the use of applications installed on the monitored device, bypassed the Android permission model, executed remote commands with escalated (system) privileges, and was able to remotely reprogram the devices.

### An ACE Up the Sleeve: Designing Active Directory DACL Backdoors
Active Directory (AD) object discretionary access control lists (DACLs) are an untapped offensive landscape, often overlooked by attackers and defenders alike. The control relationships between AD objects align perfectly with the "attackers think in graphs" philosophy and expose an entire class of previously unseen control edges, dramatically expanding the number of paths to complete domain compromise.

### And Then the Script-Kiddie Said Let There be No Light. Are Cyber-Attacks on the Power Grid Limited to Nation-State Actors?
Electricity is of paramount importance in our everyday lives. Our dependence on it is particularly evident during even brief power outages. You can think of power systems as the backbone of critical infrastructures. To date, cyber-attacks against power systems are considered to be extremely sophisticated and only within the reach of nation-states. However, through this presentation we will challenge this perception, and provide a structured methodology towards attacking a power system on a limited budget.

### Attacking Encrypted USB Keys the Hard(ware) Way
Ever wondered if your new shiny AES hardware-encrypted USB device really encrypts your data - or is just a fluke? If you have, come to our talk to find out if those products live up to the hype and hear about the results of the audit we conducted on multiples USB keys and hard drives that claim to securely encrypt data.

### Automated Detection of Vulnerabilities in Black-Box Routers (and Other Network Devices)
Network protocols are based on open standards. However, the Internet runs mostly on proprietary and closed-source network devices such as routers and switches of big-name vendors like Cisco. A slight deviation in a vendor's implementation of a standard protocol may weaken the robustness and security of the protocol, thus creating a logical vulnerability an attacker may be able to exploit. Such logical vulnerabilities will likely affect many models of devices made by that vendor. However, finding these logical vulnerabilities in protocol implementations of routers demands great efforts to reverse-engineer them.

### Automated Testing of Crypto Software Using Differential Fuzzing
We present a new and efficient approach to systematic testing of cryptographic software: differential fuzzing. Unlike general purpose software fuzzing such as afl, differential fuzzing doesn't aim to find memory corruption bugs (although they might come as a by-product), but to find logic bugs. Compared to test vectors, differential fuzzing provides greater code coverage. Compared to formal verification, differential fuzzing is easier to apply, both for testers and developers.

### AVPASS: Leaking and Bypassing Antivirus Detection Model Automatically
AVPASS is a tool for leaking the detection model of Android antivirus (AV) programs, and bypassing the AV detection by using the leaked information coupled with APK perturbation techniques. AVPASS is able to infer not only the detection features, but also hierarchy of detection rule chains. With help from the leaked model and the built-in APK perturbation functions, AVPASS is able to disguise any android malware as a benign application. Furthermore, using our novel additive mode, AVPASS supports safe querying and guarantees that one can test if the application will be detected by the AV without sending the whole or core parts of application. As a result, AVPASS leaked significant detection features of commercial AVs and achieved almost zero detection from VirusTotal when tested with more than 5,000 malware.

### Behind the Plexiglass Curtain: Stats and Stories from the Black Hat NOC

### Betraying the BIOS: Where the Guardians of the BIOS are Failing
For UEFI firmware, the barbarians are at the gate -- and the gate is open. On the one hand, well-intentioned researchers are increasingly active in the UEFI security space; on the other hand, so are attackers. Information about UEFI implants -- by HackingTeam and state-sponsored actors alike -- hints at the magnitude of the problem, but are these isolated incidents, or are they indicative of a more dire lapse in security? Just how breachable is the BIOS?

### Big Game Theory Hunting: The Peculiarities of Human Behavior in the InfoSec Game
We all groan when we hear it's "time for some game theory," but traditional game theory â modelling conflict and cooperation between rational decision-makers â still pervades how we think of defensive strategy as an industry. This primitive analysis is a disservice to defenders, who are facing humans (and who are, in fact, humans themselves), but are modelling their own actions and opponent's actions based on the assumption of machine-like behavior.

### Blue Pill for Your Phone
In this research, we've explored attack surface of hypervisors and TrustZone monitor in modern ARM based phones, using Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel as primary targets. We will explain different attack scenarios using SMC and other interfaces, as well as interaction methods between TrustZone and hypervisor privilege levels.

### Bochspwn Reloaded: Detecting Kernel Memory Disclosure with x86 Emulation and Taint Tracking
In kernel-mode, buffer overflows and similar memory corruption issues in the internal logic are usually self-evident and can be detected with a number of static and dynamic approaches. On the contrary, flaws directly related to interactions with user-mode clients tend to be more subtle, and can survive unnoticed for many years, while still providing primitives similar to the classic bugs. One example of such flaws are so-called "double fetches" â repeated accesses to single user-mode memory units within the same semantic contexts, with the assumption that their values don't change in between the reads. These are race conditions which can be often exploited to achieve memory corruption, write-what-where conditions and other dangerous primitives; yet they never manifest themselves at runtime, unless being actively exploited. In 2013, Gynvael and I devised a project called "Bochspwn", which was used to discover at least 37 double fetches in the Windows kernel, by employing a custom full-system instrumentation built on top of the Bochs x86 emulator.

### Bot vs. Bot for Evading Machine Learning Malware Detection
Machine learning offers opportunities to improve malware detection because of its ability to generalize to never-before-seen malware families and polymorphic strains.  This has resulted in its practical use for either primary detection engines or supplementary heuristic detections by AV vendors.  However, machine learning is also especially susceptible to evasion attacks by, ironically but unsurprisingly, other machine learning methods. We demonstrate how to evade machine learning malware detection by setting up an AI agent to compete against the malware detector that proactively probes it for blind spots that can be exploited. We focus on static Windows PE malware evasion, but the framework is generic and could be extended to other domains.

Breaking electronic locks looks so fun in the movies â get your "tech wizard" member of the team to plug some gadget into the control panel on the locked door, the gadget scrolls through all the combinations, and then the door opens. The hardest part is figuring out what cool catch-phrase you'll use when the door opens.

### Breaking the Laws of Robotics: Attacking Industrial Robots
Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices but include complex embedded controllers, which are often interconnected with other computers in the factory network, safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a key role, because they directly expose the robot's controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.

### Breaking the x86 Instruction Set
A processor is not a trusted black box for running code; on the contrary, modern x86 chips are packed full of secret instructions and hardware bugs.  In this talk, we'll demonstrate how page fault analysis and some creative processor fuzzing can be used to exhaustively search the x86 instruction set and uncover the secrets buried in your chipset.  We'll disclose new x86 hardware glitches, previously unknown machine instructions, ubiquitous software bugs, and flaws in enterprise hypervisors.  Best of all, we'll release our sandsifter toolset, so that you can audit - and break - your own processor.

### Broadpwn: Remotely Compromising Android and iOS via a Bug in Broadcom's Wi-Fi Chipsets
Remote exploits that compromise Android and iOS devices without user interaction have become an endangered species in recent years. Such exploits present a unique challenge: Without access to the rich scripting environment of the browser, exploit developers have been having a hard time bypassing mitigations such as DEP and ASLR.

### Bug Collisions Meet Government Vulnerability Disclosure
How often does someone find your secret bugs? The Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP) helps determine if a software vulnerability known to the U.S. government will be disclosed or kept secret. A key part of that calculation is the likelihood that some other party may have found the same vulnerability. Yet, for years there has been little to no good analysis to say how often two parties independently discover the same vulnerability.

### Cloak & Dagger: From Two Permissions to Complete Control of the UI Feedback Loop
While both the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW and the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE Android permissions have been abused individually (e.g., in UI redressing attacks, accessibility attacks), previous attacks based on these permissions failed to completely control the UI feedback loop and thus either rely on vanishing side-channels to time the appearance of overlay UI, cannot respond properly to user input, or make the attacks literally visible. In this work, we demonstrate how combining the capabilities of these permissions leads to complete control of the UI feedback loop and creates devastating and stealthy attacks. In particular, we demonstrate how an app with these two permissions can launch a variety of stealthy, powerful attacks, ranging from stealing user's login credentials and security PIN, to the silent installation of a God-like app with all permissions enabled. To make things even worse, we note that when installing an app targeting a recent Android SDK, the list of its required permissions is not shown to the user and that these attacks can be carried out without needing to lure the user to knowingly enable any permission, thus leaving him completely unsuspecting. In fact, we found that the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission is automatically granted for apps installed from the Play Store and, even though the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE is not automatically granted, our experiment shows that it is very easy to lure users to unknowingly grant that permission by abusing capabilities from the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission. We also found that it is straightforward to get a proof-of-concept app requiring both permissions accepted on the official store. We evaluated the practicality of these attacks by performing a user study: none of the 20 human subjects that took part of the experiment even suspected they had been attacked. We conclude with a number of observations and best-practices that Google and developers can adopt to secure the Android GUI.

### Cyber Wargaming: Lessons Learned in Influencing Security Stakeholders Inside and Outside Your Organization
The security industry faces a tough and growing problem: many of the fundamental decisions made which affect security are made by people that don't have the right cyber skills or experiences. This talk describes how the creation of a realistic, hands-on wargame environment can be leveraged to not only teach participants about attack and defense but to enable other organizational advantages.

### Datacenter Orchestration Security and Insecurity: Assessing Kubernetes Mesos and Docker at Scale
Your datacenter isn't a bunch of computers, it is *a* computer. While some large organizations have over a decade of experience running software-defined datacenters at massive scale, many more large organizations are just now laying the foundations for their own cloud-scale platforms based on similar ideas. Datacenter-level operating systems such as Kubernetes, Mesos, and Docker Enterprise significantly change both the computing and security paradigms of modern production environments, whether they are in the cloud, on-premises, or a hybrid of the two. The focus of a lot of security attention related to containers and DevOps has been on the kernel-level isolation mechanisms, but these modern datacenter orchestration systems make single-node privilege escalation and persistence significantly less useful. We'll go over the background of what security benefits modern datacenter-level orchestration systems provide and what challenges they also bring along with them. We'll also discuss how to think about attacking and defending entire clusters vs. single machines and what common attack patterns (privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence) look like specific to the orchestration layers instead of through the traditional native operating systems.
### Defeating Samsung KNOX with Zero Privilege
The story started mid-2016 by exploiting CVE-2016-6787 (found by myself) and rooting large numbers of Android devices shipped with 3.18 Linux kernel. However, we realized that our exploit wasn't working on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge; the usual way we used to bypass KNOX on Galaxy S6 had expired.

### Developing Trust and Gitting Betrayed
Trust is an implicit requirement of doing business - at some point, we must trust employees, peers, and technology to a degree. The lack of proper management or understanding of these various trust relationships is a leading cause of security exposure. This talk will cover the analysis and exploitation of the trust relationships between code, platforms, developers, and their parent organization. We will look at the software development life cycle and how it can be actively exploited to attack, evade defenses, and ultimately own a target organization. 
### Digital Vengeance: Exploiting the Most Notorious C&C Toolkits
Every year thousands of organizations are compromised by targeted attacks. In many cases the attacks are labeled as advanced and persistent which suggests a high level of sophistication in the attack and tools used. Many times, this title is leveraged as an excuse that the events were inevitable or irresistible, as if the assailants' skill set is well beyond what defenders are capable of. To the contrary, often these assailants are not as untouchable as many would believe.

### Don't Trust the DOM: Bypassing XSS Mitigations via Script Gadgets
Cross-Site Scripting is a constant problem of the Web platform. Over the years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS. Most of these techniques, thereby, focus on script tags and event handlers. HTML sanitizers, for example, aim at removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes. Another example is the Content Security Policy, which forbids inline event handlers and aims at white listing of legitimate scripts.

### Electronegativity - A Study of Electron Security
Despite all predictions, native Desktop apps are back. After years porting stand-alone apps to the web, we are witnessing an inverse trend. Many companies have started providing native desktop apps built using the same technologies as their web counterparts. In this trend, Github's Electron has become a popular framework to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While it seems to be easy, embedding a webapp in a self-contained web environment (Chromium, Node.Js) introduces new security challenges.

### Escalating Insider Threats Using VMware's API
Enterprises often require that their IT teams have no access to data kept inside the machines they administer, a separation that is crucial for compliance, privacy and defense in depth. To this end, industries use VMWare's rich security model to separate the infrastructure domain from the guest machine domain. For example, most companies allow their IT teams to create, modify, backup and delete guest machines, but deny them guest machine operation functions such as file manipulation and console interaction.

### Evading Microsoft ATA for Active Directory Domination
Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is a defense platform which reads information from multiple sources like traffic for certain protocols to the Domain Controller, Windows Event Logs and SIEM events. The information thus collected is used to detect Reconnaissance, Credentials replay, Lateral movement, Persistence attacks etc. Well known attacks like Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket, Overpass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket, Directory services replication, Brute-force, Skeleton key etc. can be detected using ATA. Whenever communication to a Domain Controller is done using protocols like Kerberos, NTLM, RPC, DNS, LDAP etc., ATA will parse that traffic for gathering information about not only possible attacks but user behavior as well. It slowly builds an organizational graph and can detect deviations from normal behavior.

### Evil Bubbles or How to Deliver Attack Payload via the Physics of the Process
Until now, electronic communication was considered a single avenue for delivering attack payload. However, when it comes to cyber-physical systems, this assumption does not hold true. When field devices (sensors, valves, pumps, etc.) are inserted into the process, they become related to each other by the physics of the process. Physical process is a communication media for equipment and can be leveraged for delivering malicious payload even if the devices are segregated electronically. Sensors, valves, safety systems on an isolated network, analog equipment are all vulnerable to this attack vector.

### Evilsploit â A Universal Hardware Hacking Toolkit
Hardware hacking is about to understand the inner working mechanism of hardware. Most of the time, the hardware hacking process starts from reversing. From the hardware point of view, reversing in static way includes uncovering the schematic and disassembling the binary. On the other hand, reversing in dynamic way includes finding a way to debug the hardware and to fuzz it accordingly.

### Evolutionary Kernel Fuzzing
The modern model of vulnerability mitigation includes robust sandboxing and usermode privilege separation to contain inevitable flaws in the design and implementation of software. As adoption of containment technology spreads to browsers and other software, we see the value of exploits continue to rise as multiple vulnerabilities must be chained together with extreme levels of binary artistry to achieve full system control. As such, there has recently been a high demand to identify kernel vulnerabilities that can bypass sandboxes and process isolation to successfully achieve full system compromise. 
### Exploit Kit Cornucopia
Detecting the compromised websites, gates, and dedicated hosts that make up the infrastructure used by Exploit Kits involves a variety of creative techniques. In this session, we will detail four approaches to uncovering these systems while explaining the underlying architecture of Exploit Kit networks. We will disclose a vulnerability in the injected code placed on compromised websites and exploit that vulnerability to uncover deeper infrastructure. Finally, we'll introduce a novel approach to obtaining the malware sent via phishing campaigns which is often the same result of an Exploit Kit compromise.
### Exploiting Network Printers
The idea of a paperless office has been dreamed of for more than three decades. However, nowadays printers are still one of the most essential devices for daily work and common Internet users. Instead of removing them, printers evolved from simple devices into complex network computer systems, installed directly into company networks, and carrying considerable confidential data in their print jobs. This makes them to an attractive attack target.

### Firmware is the New Black - Analyzing Past Three Years of BIOS/UEFI Security Vulnerabilities
In recent years, we witnessed the rise of firmware-related vulnerabilities, likely a direct result of increasing adoption of exploit mitigations in major/widespread operating systems - including for mobile phones. Pairing that with the recent (and not so recent) leaks of government offensive capabilities abusing supply chains and using physical possession to persist on compromised systems, it is clear that firmware is the new black in security. This research looks into BIOS/UEFI platform firmware, trying to help making sense of the threat. We present a threat model, discuss new mitigations that could have prevented the issues and offer a categorization of bug classes that hopefully will help focusing investments in protecting systems (and finding new vulnerabilities). Our data set comprises of 90+ security vulnerabilities handled by Intel Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) in the past 3 years and the analysis was manually performed, using white-box and counting with feedback from various BIOS developers within the company (and security researchers externally that reported some of the issues - most of the issues were found by internal teams, but PSIRT is involved since they were found to also affect released products).

### FlowFuzz - A Framework for Fuzzing OpenFlow-Enabled Software and Hardware Switches
Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm which aims for increasing the flexibility of current network deployments by separating the data from the control plane and by providing programmable interfaces to configure the network. Resulting in a more agile and eased network management and therefore in cost savings, SDN is already deployed in live networks i.e. Google's B4 backbone and NOKIA's cloud infrastructure. Despite these benefits, SDN broadens the attack surface as additional networking devices and protocols are deployed. Due their critical role within the softwarized management of the network, these devices and protocols are high ranked targets for potential attackers and thus require extensive testing and hardening.

### Fractured Backbone: Breaking Modern OS Defenses with Firmware Attacks
In this work we analyzed two recent trends. The first trend is the growing threat of firmware attacks which include recent disclosures of Vault7 Mac EFI implants. We will detail vulnerabilities and attacks we discovered recently in system firmware including UEFI, Mac EFI and Coreboot which could lead to stealth and persistent firmware implants. We have also developed multiple techniques that can be used to detect that something wrong is going on with the firmware using open source CHIPSEC framework.

### Friday the 13th: JSON Attacks
2016 was the year of Java deserialization apocalypse. Although Java Deserialization attacks were known for years, the publication of the Apache Commons Collection Remote Code Execution (RCE from now on) gadget finally brought this forgotten vulnerability to the spotlight and motivated the community to start finding and fixing these issues. One of the most suggested solutions for avoiding Java deserialization issues was to move away from Java Deserialization altogether and use safer formats such as JSON. In this talk, we will analyze the most popular JSON parsers in both .NET and Java for potential RCE vectors.

### Go Nuclear: Breaking Radiation Monitoring Devices
USA, 1979: The Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station suffered a core meltdown. Operators were unable to cope with the ambiguous signals the plant's HMI was sending, leading to one of the most serious nuclear accidents on US soil. Spain, 2007: Bypassing security checks, someone stole approximately 70 fuel pellets of uranium oxide from a nuclear fuel facility. They were later found abandoned nearby. How this material ended up there is still a mystery. Are these scenarios possible now? Critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants, seaports, borders, and even hospitals are equipped with radiation monitoring devices. This equipment detects and prevents threats ranging from nuclear material smuggling to radiation contamination.

### Hacking Hardware with a $10 SD Card Reader
Dumping firmware from hardware, utilizing a non-eMMC flash storage device, can be a daunting task with expensive programmers required, 15+ wires to solder (or a pricey socket), and dumps that contain extra data to allow for error correction. With the growing widespread use of eMMC flash storage, the process can be simplified to 5 wires and a cheap SD card reader/writer allowing for direct access to the filesystem within flash in an interface similar to that of using an SD card.

### Hacking Serverless Runtimes: Profiling AWS Lambda Azure Functions and More
Serverless technology is getting increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise and startup communities. As micro-services multiply and single purpose services grow, how do you audit and defend serverless runtimes? The advantages of serverless runtimes are clear: increased agility, ease of use, and ephemerality (i.e., not managing a fleet of "pet" servers). There is a trade off for that convenience though - reduced transparency. In this talk, we will deep dive into both public data and information unearthed by our research to give you the full story on serverless, how it works, and attack chains in the serverless cloud(s) Azure, AWS, and a few other sandboxes. Who will be the victor in the great sandbox showdown?

### Honey I Shrunk the Attack Surface â Adventures in Android Security Hardening
Information security is ever evolving, and Android's security posture is no different. Users and application developers have high expectations that their data will be kept safe, private, and secure, and it's the responsibility of the Android Security Team to enable this. To do this, Android has focused on four critical principles of information security: exploit mitigation, exploit containment, attack surface reduction, and safe-by-default features.

### How We Created the First SHA-1 Collision and What it Means for Hash Security
In February 2017, we announced the first SHA-1 collision. This collision combined with a clever use of the PDF format allows attackers to forge PDF pairs that have identical SHA-1 hashes and yet display different content. This attack is the result of over two years of intense research. It took 6500 CPU years and 110 GPU years of computations which is still 100,000 times faster than a brute-force attack.

### Intel AMT Stealth Breakthrough
Every modern computer system based on Intel architecture has Intel Management Engine (ME) - a built-in subsystem with a wide array of powerful capabilities (such as full access to operating memory, out-of-band access to a network interface, running independently of CPU even when it is in a shutdown state, etc.). On the one hand, these capabilities allow Intel to implement many features and technologies based on Intel ME. On the other hand, it makes Intel ME a tempting target for an attacker. Especially, if an attack can be conducted remotely.

### kR^X: Comprehensive Kernel Protection Against Just-In-Time Code Reuse
The abundance of memory corruption and disclosure vulnerabilities in kernel code necessitates the deployment of hardening techniques to prevent privilege escalation attacks. As more strict memory isolation mechanisms between the kernel and user space, like Intel's SMEP, become commonplace, attackers increasingly rely on code reuse techniques to exploit kernel vulnerabilities. Contrary to similar attacks in more restrictive settings, such as web browsers, in kernel exploitation, non-privileged local adversaries have great flexibility in abusing memory disclosure vulnerabilities to dynamically discover, or infer, the location of certain code snippets and construct code-reuse payloads.

SQLite is widely used as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software, such as web browsers and mobile applications. As a relational database, SQLite is vulnerable to SQL injection attack, which has been well-studied for a long time. Memory corruption bugs in SQLite are usually not considered security issues, since they are normally unlikely to be exploitable. In this talk, we will study several remotely exploitable memory corruption cases to show the dangerous attack surface in SQLite.

Autonomic systems are smart systems which do not need any human management or intervention. Cisco is one of the first companies to deploy the technology in which the routers are just "Plug and Play" with no need for configuration. All that is needed is 5 commands to build fully automated network. It is already supported in pretty much all of the recent software images for enterprise level and carrier grade routers/switches. This is the bright side of the technology. On the other hand, the configuration is hidden and the interfaces are inaccessible. The protocol is proprietary and there is no mechanism to know what is running within your network.

### Ochko123 - How the Feds Caught Russian Mega-Carder Roman Seleznev
How did the Feds catch the notorious Russian computer hacker Roman Seleznev - the person responsible for over 400 point of sale hacks and at least $169 million in credit card fraud? What challenges did the government face piecing together the international trail of electronic evidence that he left? How was Seleznev located and ultimately arrested? This presentation will begin with a review of the investigation that will include a summary of the electronic evidence that was collected and the methods used to collect that evidence. The team that convicted Seleznev will show how that evidence of user attribution was used to finger Seleznev as the hacker and infamous credit card broker behind the online nics nCuX, Track2, Bulba and 2Pac. The presentation will further discuss efforts to locate Seleznev, a Russian national, and apprehend him while he vacationed in the Maldives. Finally, the presentation will cover the August 2016 federal jury trial with a focus on computer forensic issues, including how prosecutors used Microsoft Windows artifacts to successfully combat Seleznev's trial defense. They argued that the laptop he was arrested with had been tampered with and that evidence on the laptop had been planted by a mysterious super hacker.
### Offensive Malware Analysis: Dissecting OSX/FruitFly via a Custom C&C Server
Creating a custom command and control (C&C) server for someone else's malware has a myriad of benefits. If you can take over a domain, you then may able to fully hijack other hackers' infected hosts. A more prosaic benefit is expediting analysis. While hackers and governments may be more interested in the former, malware analysts can benefit from the latter.

### OpenCrypto: Unchaining the JavaCard Ecosystem
JavaCard is a subset of Java that allows applets to run securely on smartcards and has been deployed to over 15 billion devices. Its main advantage compared to competing technologies is "applet interoperability." Unfortunately, over the years, several glitches in the ecosystem became apparent, and hindered its evolution. For instance, in practice, most applets are tailored for a specific card model, while there is at least a three-year gap between the time a JavaCard specification is released, and the time features appear in products.

### Protecting Visual Assets: Digital Image Counter-Forensics
They say an image is worth a thousand words, and surely that means it's worth spending a few words protecting. While most data security policies and practices today focus on primarily text or document-based asset hardening and protection, visual assets (e.g. photographs) are often left vulnerable to adversarial data collection. To use a simple yet damaging example, can you imagine posting a photo of a location-sensitive data center only to forget to remove GPS coordinates from the image's metadata? What about a student ID number seen on an Instagram feed, which, when coupled with photos of the same target's birthday party, can be used to obtain their university credentials?

### Quantifying Risk in Consumer Software at Scale - Consumer Reports' Digital Standard
Last year Mudge and Sarah pulled back the curtains on the non-profit Cyber Independent Testing Laboratory: An organization designed to quantify the efficacy of security development practices and predict future software risks and vulnerabilities. One of the surprise discoveries was that their methodologies mapped to the pricing structure of the underground 0day market. 
### RBN Reloaded - Amplifying Signals from the Underground
Threat intelligence gains immensely in clarity and precision when signals intelligence (SIGINT) and on-the-ground human intelligence (HUMINT) work closely in tandem. This fusion offers the best opportunity to build real visibility into an adversary's TTPs, intent, sophistication and composition. As a result, a deeper understanding of the adversary not only leads to better decision making to mitigate the threat, but also helps to proactively exploit pain points and have a longer lasting impact.
### Real Humans Simulated Attacks: Usability Testing with Attack Scenarios
User studies are critical to understanding how users perceive and interact with security and privacy software and features. While it is important that users be able to configure and use security tools when they are not at risk, it is even more important that the tools continue to protect users during an attack. Conducting user studies in the presence of (simulated) risk is complicated. We would like to observe how users behave when they are actually at risk, but at the same time we cannot harm user study participants or subject them to increased risk. Often the risky situations we are interested in occur relatively infrequently in the real world, and thus can be difficult to observe in the wild. Researchers use a variety of strategies to overcome these challenges and place participants in situations where they will believe their security or privacy is at risk, without subjecting them to increases in actual harm. In some studies, researchers recruit participants to perform real tasks not directly related to security so that they can observe how participants respond to simulated security-related prompts or cues that occur while users are focused on primary tasks. In other studies, researchers create a hypothetical scenario and try to get participants sufficiently engaged in it that they will be motivated to avoid simulated harm. Sometimes researchers have the opportunity to observe real, rather than simulated attacks, although these opportunities are usually difficult to come by. Researchers can monitor real world user behavior over long periods of time (in public or with permission of participants) and observe how users respond to risks that occur naturally, without researcher intervention. In this talk, I will motivate the importance of security user studies and talk about a number of different user study approaches we have used at the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.

### Redesigning PKI to Solve Revocation Expiration and Rotation Problems
As the previous Director of Security at companies like Linksys, Belkin, and Wink, I learned hard lessons about the pitfalls of PKI. This was especially true on IoT devices, where the responsibility was on consumers or site managers to update & fix devices when security issues arose. I've experienced expired keys that killed device connections, private keys being accidentally dropped on consumer devices, and breaches that required replacing all keys on devices, servers, and user applications. This led me to create oneID, now called Neustar TDI, which is an open source framework that replaces PKI with one that has real-time revocation, key rotation, key reset/replacement, and individual identities for every device, server, service, and user. It starts with the premise that every server, service, network, device, and user will be compromised at some point, so we should start our security model with that assumption and build protection to limit that as much as possible. It specifically does not trust anything by default and trust continually has to be proven, rather than trusting and checking for revocation. It puts the SOC or NOC in control rather than the users or site managers.

### Revoke-Obfuscation: PowerShell Obfuscation Detection (And Evasion) Using Science
Attackers, administrators and many legitimate products rely on PowerShell for their core functionality. However, being a Windows-signed binary native on Windows 7 and later that enables reflective injection of binaries and DLLs and memory-resident execution of remotely hosted scripts, has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity malware authors alike. In environments where PowerShell is heavily used, filtering out legitimate activity to detect malicious PowerShell usage is not trivial.

### rVMI: A New Paradigm for Full System Analysis
Debuggers can play a valuable role in dynamic malware analysis, but these tools fall short in many areas for an obvious reason: their primary objective is debugging and not analyzing malware. Modern malware uses a variety of anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques that actively exploit this reality. Techniques range from the simple use of APIs and breakpoint detection to sophisticated multi-stage/multi-process architectures. Such malware exploits the fact that debuggers are best suited for single-process analysis and run within the same environment as the sample, which makes them vulnerable to detection and evasion.

### ShieldFS: The Last Word in Ransomware Resilient File Systems
Preventive and reactive security measures can only partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. The remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cybercriminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes demonstrate that current defense solutions are failing, and a large number of users are actually paying the ransoms. In fact, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient, because, when luck allows a sample to be isolated and analyzed, it is already too late for several users! Moreover, modern ransomware implements several techniques to prevent detection by common AV. Similarly, for performance reasons, backups leave a small-but-important window of recent files unprotected.

### Skype & Type: Keystroke Leakage over VoIP
It is well-known that acoustic emanations of computer keyboards represent a serious privacy issue. As demonstrated in prior work, physical properties of keystroke sounds might reveal what a user is typing. However, previous attacks assumed physical proximity to the victim, to place compromised microphones. We argue that this is hardly realistic. We also observe that during VoIP calls people often engage in secondary activities (including typing), unintentionally giving potential eavesdroppers full access to their microphone. From these observations, we build a new attack, called Skype&Type (S&T), that involves VoIP software.

### Sonic Gun to Smart Devices: Your Devices Lose Control Under Ultrasound/Sound
MEMS sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, play non-substitutive roles in modern smart devices. A vulnerability has been revealed that the inside sensing elements will resonate when imposed acoustic wave at the certain frequencies, thus yielding spoiled data. We developed the attack method and achieved data manipulation via precise parameter tuning for both gyroscopes and accelerometers. Also, we invented a joint attack by combining both ones providing hackers with more versatility. We will explore extensively the impact of this vulnerability among several categories of devices with MEMS sensors onboard, including VR devices, self-balancing vehicles, and drones.

### SS7 Attacker Heaven Turns into Riot: How to Make Nation-State and Intelligence Attackers' Lives Much Harder on Mobile Networks
The SS7 mobile vulnerabilities affect the security of all mobile users worldwide. The SS7 is signalisation between Mobile Operators Core Network about where your mobile phone is located and where to send media, so the secured end-device does not help here, as it is only a consequence of having legitimate SS7 traffic. To protect against SS7 vulnerabilities, you need to play at operator-level. And this was not really the kind of thing you could do up till now.

### Taking DMA Attacks to the Next Level: How to do Arbitrary Memory Reads/Writes in a Live and Unmodified System Using a Rogue Memory Controller
Physical DMA attacks on devices and the ability to read and modify memory contents can be a serious security threat, especially for mobile devices, which can be easily lost or stolen, and for government and remote enterprise data centers, where entry of an untrusted entity can be easily overlooked. In particular, the ability to read memory can expose secrets (i.e. disk encryption keys) that reside thereon, and the ability to actively modify memory can be used to bypass the platform's security policies/mechanisms. However, those types of attacks typically require a specific interface (e.g. Thunderboltâ¢) to operate and can also be mitigated by blocking associated drivers and ports.

### The Active Directory Botnet
Botnets and C&C servers are taking over the internet and are a major threat to all of us ... but what happens when these botnets and C&C servers start existing and operating inside the walls of our organisations? What if these botnets and C&C servers could bypass all of our network controls? What if these botnets and C&C servers could communicate internally across our security zones and organisations? What if micro-segmentation suddenly became useless?

### The Adventures of AV and the Leaky Sandbox
Everyone loves cloud-AV. It incorporates up-to-date intelligence from multiple global sources ("wisdom of the clouds"), and (in theory) it has small footprint. There's simply no downside in moving to cloud-AV, right? Consider a high-security enterprise with strict egress filtering, that is - endpoints have no direct Internet connection, or the endpoints' connection to the Internet is restricted to hosts used by their legitimately installed software. Let's say there's malware running on one of the endpoints with all the privileges it needs. This is bad of course, but thankfully, the last line of defense is there - the malware can't really exfiltrate data to the Internet, due to the strict Internet connection policy enforcement.

### The Future of ApplePwn - How to Save Your Money
When people ask about wireless payments (PayPass, ApplePay, SamsungPay, etc), everyone certainly claims that ApplePay is one of the most secure systems. The separate microprocessor for payments (Secure Enclave), absence of card data storing/transmitting in plaintext during payments look like an ideal defense. However, the devil is in the details! We'll present a specially developed opensource utilities which demonstrates how hackers can reconnect your card to their iPhone or make fraudulent payments directly on the victim's phone, even without a jailbreak.

### The Shadow Brokers â Cyber Fear Game-Changers

### They're Coming for Your Tools: Exploiting Design Flaws for Active Intrusion Prevention
Several popular attack tools and techniques remain effective in the real world, even though they are well understood and documented. Consequently, many attackers and other individuals within the professional penetration testing community have not grown beyond their tools, partially because of the effectiveness of several widely available attack scripts. In this talk, we hope to offer a more active approach toward intrusion prevention that enables defenders to use simple network software applications to seek out these attacks. By using active intrusion detection strategies, administrators can create a situation where attackers who are overly reliant on their tools will expose themselves to detection and other significant complications.

### Well that Escalated Quickly! How Abusing Docker API Led to Remote Code Execution Same Origin Bypass and Persistence in the Hypervisor via Shadow Containers
With over 5 billion pulls from the Docker Hub, Docker is proving to be the most dominant technology in an exploding trend of containerization. An increasing number of production applications are now running inside containers; and to get to production, developers first use containers on their own machines. Docker offers its developer versions supporting Linux, Mac, and even Windows. To support Windows and Mac developers, Docker uses their respective hypervisors to run linux containers.

### What They're Teaching Kids These Days: Comparing Security Curricula and Accreditations to Industry Needs
Security is hard, but security education may be harder. Few academic institutions have the skills or resources to dedicate solely to security education. Rather, most security programs in higher education have grown out of or have been welded on to other technology programs. The resulting fractured educational ecosystem has created a disparity in the skill sets of graduating students and has made it challenging to develop standards to ensure consistency across educational programs. This talk will take a look at how security curricula have traditionally been developed and continued to be shaped by a variety of forces. We will examine some of the proposed solutions for accrediting programs and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we will try to determine which type of student each model is designed to produce and provide our own recommendations about how to standardize security education.

### White Hat Privilege:  The Legal Landscape for a Cybersecurity Professional Seeking to Safeguard Sensitive Client Data
The law affords unique protections to communications between a lawyer and client, commonly referred to as the "attorney-client privilege."  This tool is indispensable because a lawyer can best advocate for a client when the client is free to disclose both the good and the bad.  The law affords similar protections to communications between a physician/therapist and patient.

### Why Most Cyber Security Training Fails and What We Can Do About it
To date, the only pro-active, user-focused solution against spear phishing has been cyber security awareness training. However, multiple lines of evidenceâfrom continuing news stories of bigger and bolder breaches to objective academic assessments of training effectsâpoint to its limited effectiveness. 
### WiFuzz: Detecting and Exploiting Logical Flaws in the Wi-Fi Cryptographic Handshake
Encrypted Wi-Fi networks are increasingly popular. This is highlighted by new standards such as Hotspot 2.0 and Opportunistic Wireless Encryption. Hotspot 2.0 streamlines network discovery and selection, creating an authenticated roaming experience matching that of cellular phones. On the other hand, Opportunistic Wireless Encryption introduces unauthenticated encryption for Wi-Fi networks. However, these advancements are meaningless if there are implementation flaws in the cryptographic 4-way Wi-Fi handshake that negotiates the fresh session keys.

### Wire Me Through Machine Learning
In this world of technology where communication through email plays an important role, vicious threats also follow. One of the most beautifully crafted email threat commonly known as Business email compromise (BEC) scam or CEO fraud has shown its impact on more than 400 Organizations resulting in loss of over US $3 billion. Business email compromise (BEC) scam, also known as whaling, is a targeted attack sent to higher level management specifically to C level executives masquerading as an email communication from a CEO to a CFO. These emails are designed in a way that they have the power to influence the target to perform financial transactions such as wire transfers on a short notice. These attacks are successfully carried out by first building trust of the target.

### WSUSpendu: How to Hang WSUS Clients
You are performing a pentest. You just owned the first domain controller. That was easy. All the computers belong to you, but unfortunately, you can't reach the final goal. The last target is further in the network, inaccessible and heavily filtered. Thankfully, one last hope remains. You realize the target domain pulls its updates from the WSUS server of the compromised domain, the one you fully control. Hope is back...but once again, it fails. The only tools available for controlling the updates are not working: they require a network attack that is prevented by the network architecture and the server configuration. All hope is lost...
